Welcome to my blog. I'll be writing about backend engineering, distributed systems, and things I'm learning along the way.

## What to Expect

- Deep dives on systems topics — workflow orchestration, event-driven architecture, database internals
- Notes on tools and languages I'm working with (Go, Python, Temporal, AWS)
- Occasional thoughts on engineering craft and career

Stay tuned.
